Hello, welcome to the video.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today we're going to discuss 
the basics of SRT files.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
You will learn how to create and format them.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's get started!

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,000
First, you need a text editor to write your SRT file.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Make sure to save it with the .srt extension.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Each subtitle entry starts with a number.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Then, you need a time code for 
when the subtitle should appear.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The time code format is: hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Finally, you write the subtitle text below the time code.
